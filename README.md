# Democratizing fraud detection in real time effectively and efficiently

Online fraud transactions is becoming increasingly difficult to prevent, this is because cybercriminals have become more sophisticated in their attacks and traditional fraud detection mechanisms have become less effective.
A recent pwc study with more than 5,000 institutions across 99 territories indicates that the reported amount of losses from fraud reached the $42 billion in the past two years.
The 13% of those companies had losses over $50 million and only 56% of them carried out an investigation into their most critical incident.

These figures are indeed alarming, therefore according to Gartner, by 2023, 30% of banking and electronic commerce institutions will include, as a critical requirement, the fraud detection capabilities of providers in more than 75% RFPs, which represents an increase of 25% compared to today.
